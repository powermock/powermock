Hey there and thank you for using PowerMock

Please read the following tips before filing an issue:

Is this something you can debug and fix?
-------------------------------------------------------

Can you see anything in the logs? Can you debug why this happens? **Send a pull request**! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are very welcome.


Is this question about PowerMock usage?
---------------------------------------

The better way to ask question:

* The PowerMock [mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/powermock/)
* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/powermock) with the tag 'powermock'. (Make sure you **include a short code snippet to demonstrate the problem** and if you have an exception then make sure **include stack trace**.)

None of the above, want to create a GitHub issue
------------------------------------------------------------------

Issues should always have a [Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable)](http://sscce.org), Example (same as any question on stackoverflow.com)
